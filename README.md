# Walmart-SQL-Project

## Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end data analysis solution designed to extract critical business insights from Walmart sales data. We utilize SQL for advanced querying, and structured problem-solving techniques to solve key business questions. The project is for data analysts looking to develop skills in data manipulation, SQL querying.

## Project Steps

### 1. Download Walmart Sales Data
   - **Data Source**: Use the Kaggle API to download the Walmart sales datasets from Kaggle.
   - **Dataset Link**: [Walmart Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/najir0123/walmart-10k-sales-datasets)

### 2. Explore the Data
   - **Goal**: Conduct an initial data exploration to understand data distribution, check column names, types, and identify potential issues.
   - **Analysis**: Use functions like `.info()`, `.describe()`, and `.head()` to get a quick overview of the data structure and statistics.

### 3. Data Cleaning
   - **Remove Duplicates**: Identify and remove duplicate entries to avoid skewed results.
   - **Handle Missing Values**: Drop rows or columns with missing values if they are insignificant; fill values where essential.
   - **Fix Data Types**: Ensure all columns have consistent data types (e.g., dates as `datetime`, prices as `float`).
   - **Currency Formatting**: Use `.replace()` to handle and format currency values for analysis.
   - **Validation**: Check for any remaining inconsistencies and verify the cleaned data.

### 4. SQL Analysis: Complex Queries and Business Problem Solving
   - **Business Problem-Solving**: Write and execute complex SQL queries to answer critical business questions, such as:
     - Revenue trends across branches and categories.
     - Identifying best-selling product categories.
     - Sales performance by time, city, and payment method.
     - Analyzing peak sales periods and customer buying patterns.
     - Profit margin analysis by branch and category.
   - **Documentation**: Keep clear notes of each query's objective, approach, and results.
